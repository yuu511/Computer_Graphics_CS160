    Points Attempted
    <ul>
      <li> Assignment 2 : All Required Points </li>
      <li> Assignment 2: All Extra points</li>
    </ul>
    Notes to Grader
    <p> 
    code is built off straight from my first assignment rather than the starter code
    </p>
    <p>
    saving and loading objects have trouble with shared index points, as the format specifies only 1 index
    </p>
    <p>
    "smoothing" was attempted by always using the end face of the cylinder before it when drawing a cylinder as a start point
